## A Git Training Dummy Respository

This is a repository containing some dummy files, folders and text. The purpose is to create a scenario where multiple authors can attempt to create a scenario of conflict in repository.
There is no structure to the content - it is purely a mix of Folders, Files and each File containing some text.

The important part is to focus on Git Tree, Commit Message and the branching.

**Do note, this repository can change and be corrupted by anyone. Don't believe this!**
